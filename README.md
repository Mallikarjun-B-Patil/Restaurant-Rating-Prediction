# 🍽️ Restaurant Rating Prediction

This project predicts **restaurant ratings** (Aggregate Rating) based on features such as **City, Cuisine Type, Price Range, and Votes**.  
The app is built using **Streamlit** and leverages a **Linear Regression model** trained on the provided dataset.  



## 📌 Project Overview
Restaurant rating prediction is an important task for food delivery platforms and customers to estimate the quality of a restaurant based on its attributes.  
This project:
- Preprocesses the dataset (handles missing values, encodes categorical features, scales numerical values).
- Trains a **Linear Regression model** on the fly.
- Provides an **interactive Streamlit app** for predicting restaurant ratings.


## 🛠 Features Used
- **City**: Location of the restaurant.
- **Cuisines**: Type of cuisines served.
- **Price Range**: Cost category (1 to 4).
- **Votes**: Number of user votes for the restaurant.



## ⚙️ Tech Stack
